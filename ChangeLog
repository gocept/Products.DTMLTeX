 Version 0.3

    - TeX executable paths are now configurable per instance (default:
    /usr/bin/pdftex)

    - Temporary path is not configurable per instance (default: /tmp)

    - Content-Type is now configurable per instance (default: application/pdf)
    and per call (by using the "tex_ct" parameter). If the tex_ct is a string
    without a "/" in it, the content type will be constructed as the instance
    content type + the parameter. Example:

        Content-Type on instance:   application/pdf
        tex_ct parameter:           print
        Resulting Content-Type:     application/pdf-print

    You can use this to bring your browser to print things automatically or
    something ...

    If the tec_ct has a "/" in it, then it will be the content type.

    - Added support for Zope 2.4 (some errors with the monkey patch). Thanks
    to Ivo van der Wijk.

    - You can optionally view the rendered DTML code instead of passing it to
    the TeX interpreter, by putting "tex_raw" in the Request. 

    - Some code cleanups.
