 Version 0.3

    - Added support for structured Text. Thanks to Andres Kostyrka.

    - Temporary path is now configurable per instance (default: /tmp)

    - You can define multiple filters (pdftex, pdflatex, latex ...) for each
    instance now (default are pdflatex and a latex generator script). You can
    define one as the default, and select another filter on the fly, by
    defining "tex_filter" in the request. (Like ?tex_filter=ps, or
    ?tex_filter=pdf). Thanks to Ivo van der Wijk for initial code on this.

    - Added some security assertions

    - Cleaned up the management tabs

    - Added support for Zope 2.5

    - Added support for Zope 2.4 (some errors with the monkey patch). Thanks
    to Ivo van der Wijk.

    - You can optionally view the rendered DTML code instead of passing it to
    the TeX interpreter, by putting "tex_raw" in the Request. 

    - Some code cleanups.
