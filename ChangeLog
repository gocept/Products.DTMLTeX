Trunk

    - Ensured necessary reruns of longtable environments are recongnized.

    - Slightly better handling of errors when calling LaTeX.

Version 0.7pre3

    - Set content type for LaTeX error pages to text/html to override the
      default of text/xml.

    - Added \ensuremath wrappers for math mode characters like
      superscripts to tex_quote. This makes it a very good idea to use
      tex_quote only on unicode strings.

    - Some fixes and code clean-up.

Version 0.7pre2

    - Removed DTML-Var monkeypatch

    - Added new "texvar" DTML command with special modifiers tex_quote and
      format_maps. Some format maps are predefined: nl_to_dbs (\n -> \\),
      nl_to_newline (\n -> \newline), tab_to_amp (\t -> &).

Version 0.6

    - Encoding, filename and download attributes are now configurable
      through the ZMI.

    - Improved latex running behaviour.

    - Some code clean-up.

Version 0.6pre2

    - Fixed nesting yet again.

    - Character encoding awareness introduced. Currently, encodings other
      than ASCII must be requested through the encoding parameter.

    - Reworked option handling. There are now defaults defined by the
      class, overridden by REQUEST parameters, overridden by call
      parameters. Configurability through the ZMI is planned.

Version 0.6pre1

    - New calling parameters for controlling delivery behaviour:
        * deliver: whether to affect the HTTP response.
          Default is True.
        * download: whether to add a Content-Disposition header.
          Default is False.
        * filename: filename to save a downloaded document under.

Version 0.5.2

    - Example now demonstrates recursive use of DTMLTeX.

    - Some code clean-up.

Version 0.5.1

    - A bug preventing nested DTMLTeX methods has been fixed.

Version 0.5

    - Changed file extension handling to head MIME type.

    - Added DTML modifier for escaping newlines.

    - Better error messages.

    - Added tests.

    - Code cleanups.

    - New example.

 Version 0.3

    - Added Windows compatibility by using spawnv instead of fork, using
      tempfile in a more generic fashion and using explicit binary mode for
      reading a file.

    - Some security enhancements (no paths TTW anymore, clean 2.4 security
      machinery upgrade)

    - Fixed a bug with newer Zopes (invalid amount of parameters for
      __call__). Thanks to Frank Poetzsch-Heffter.

    - Added support for structured Text. Thanks to Andres Kostyrka.

    - Fixed a bug with the ZODB File support. Thanks to Frank
      Poetzsch-Heffter.

    - Temporary path is now configurable per instance (default: /tmp)

    - You can define multiple filters (pdftex, pdflatex, latex ...) for the
      class (default are pdflatex and a latex generator script). You can
      define one as the default, and select another filter on the fly, by
      defining "tex_filter" in the request. (Like ?tex_filter=ps, or
      ?tex_filter=pdf). Thanks to Ivo van der Wijk for initial code on this.

    - Added some security assertions

    - Cleaned up the management tabs

    - Added support for Zope 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7

    - Added support for Zope 2.4 (some errors with the monkey patch). Thanks
      to Ivo van der Wijk.

    - You can optionally view the rendered DTML code instead of passing it to
      the TeX interpreter, by putting "tex_raw" in the Request.

    - Some code cleanups.
