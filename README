DTMLTeX

This is DTMLTeX, a Zope Product, that is similar to the DTML Method,
but which gets send through pdftex (you may replace this to the default
latex/dvips procuedure) and sends you a pdf file as view.

This release is based on the Zope Product found on zope.org, created
originally by Marian Kelc.

PREREQUISITES

pdftex

pdftex should be installed in /usr/bin, otherwise change dtmltex.py 
This mean, you must have installed this tool. The package assumes the 
binaries in /usr/bin/... - you can change this behavior with editing the
DTMLTeX.py File. 

In the content you can use all DTML-Tags you know. For the special
case, you want to include a file (e.g. an eps-file) that is stored in
the Zope Database as a File-Object, a "create_temp" Method is added to
the File class. This creates a temporary copy of the Files content in
the systems tmp-directory and inserts the temporary name of the File
at the place, where it was called 
(e.g. <dtml-var "myfile.create_temp()">).  

If the File Object has the property "suffix", this is added to the
filename on disk, but not on that rendered (if you dont want the
latter, you can use the keyword-parameter sfx=1).  The temporary copy
is erased after a certain amount of time (keyword-parameter t,
defaults to 60 seconds) through a Thread, that was started at call of
create_temp and keeps sleeping for this time.

Additionally there is a new dtml-var modifier called "tex_quote" 
which quotes the value to be TeX content compatible.

You can find a (german) example for this tool in example.dtml.
I used it to automate the generation of certificates for the 
participiants of my perl-courses.
