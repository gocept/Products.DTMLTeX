DTMLTeX

This is DTMLTeX, a Zope Product similar to the DTML Method, but which
gets sent through pdflatex (you may replace this with the default
latex/dvips procedure) and sends you a pdf file as view.

This release is based on the Zope Product found on zope.org, created
originally by Marian Kelc.

PREREQUISITES

pdflatex

pdflatex should be installed in /usr/bin, otherwise change DTMLTeX.py
This means that you must have installed a TeX system. The package
assumes the binaries in /usr/bin/ - you can change this behavior by
editing the DTMLTeX.py file.

USAGE

In the content you can use all DTML-Tags you know. For the special
case that you want to include a file (e.g. a jpg file) stored in the
Zope Database as a File-Object, a "create_temp" Method is added to the
File class. This creates a temporary copy of the File's content in the
system's tmp directory and inserts the temporary name of the File at
the place where it was called (e.g.
<dtml-var "myfile.create_temp()">).

If the File Object has the property "suffix", this is added to the
filename on disk, but not on that rendered (if you don't want the
latter, you can use the keyword-parameter sfx=1). The temporary copy
is erased after a certain amount of time (keyword parameter t,
defaults to 60 seconds) by a Thread started when calling create_temp
and sleeping during this time.

Additionally there is a new dtml-var modifier called "tex_quote" 
which quotes the value to be TeX content compatible.

EXAMPLES

You can find a (german) example for this tool in example.dtml.
I used it to automate the generation of certificates for the 
participiants of my perl courses.
