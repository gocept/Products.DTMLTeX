DTMLTeX

This is DTMLTeX, a Zope Product similar to the DTML Method, but which
gets sent through pdflatex (you may replace this with the default
latex/dvips procedure) and sends you a pdf file as view.

This release is based on the Zope Product found on zope.org by
Christian Theune <ct@gocept.com>.

PREREQUISITES

pdflatex

pdflatex should be installed in /usr/bin, otherwise change DTMLTeX.py
This means that you must have installed a TeX system. The package
assumes the binaries in /usr/bin/ - you can change this behavior by
editing the DTMLTeX.py file.

USAGE

In the content you can use all DTML-Tags you know. For the special
case that you want to include a file (e.g. a jpg file) stored in the
Zope Database as a File-Object, a "create_temp" Method is added to the
File class. This creates a temporary copy of the File's content in the
system's tmp directory and inserts the temporary name of the File at
the place where it was called (e.g.
<dtml-var "myfile.create_temp()">).

The temporary copy is erased after a certain amount of time (keyword
parameter t, defaults to 60 seconds) by a Thread started when calling
create_temp and sleeping during this time.

Additionally there is a new dtml-var modifier called "tex_quote" 
which quotes the value to be TeX content compatible.

EXAMPLES

You can find a example for this tool in example.dtml. It's a letter
typeset using the KOMA-script letter class scrlttr2 and includes an
image as well as variables of several types.

HISTORY

This Product was first developed by Marian Kelc in 1999. Due to
changes in Zope and lack of time from Marian, Christian Theune
<ct@gocept.com> took over. The current maintainer is Thomas Lotze
<tl@gocept.com>, starting March 2004.

In 2002, Andreas Kostyrka <andreas@kostyrka.priv.at> added the
following features:

- Conversion of Structured Text to LaTeX.
  + <dtml-var stxtxt fmt=structured-tex>
    This adds the formatted LaTeX code for stxtxt.
- StructuredDocument support.
  If the StructuredDocument product by maik.jablonski@uni-bielefeld.de
  is found, it is patched to support a /pdf method that creates a PDF
  version of the document.
  standard_latex_header and standard_latex_footer are stuck onto the
  LaTeX generated from the Document.

  For an example in production use see http://www.detox.at/ and

BUGS

It is not generally possible to find out for sure whether a given
DTMLTeX call is the original one made by whoever requested the LaTeX
or PDF document, or a nested dtml-var call, either direct or through
methods other than DTMLTeX. Therefore it may happen that DTMLTeX tries
to throw only part of a document at pdflatex, which results in a LaTeX
error.

Additionally, it is hardly possible to sensibly propagate those errors
from LaTeX calls on nested parts of documents. The clean thing would
be to use exceptions, but if we can't know whether we are in a nested
call, we can't decide whether to propagate the exception or not. (And
we don't want to raise an exception in the top-level call after all,
but rather do a nice error page.)
