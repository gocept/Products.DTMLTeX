Using the example
=================

The DTMLTeX usage example implements a letter. In order to see it
working, do the following:

Create a new folder in your Zope instance. Call it "example_folder".

Create a new DTMLTeX object in it. Call it "example_file". Upload the
	file example.dtml to its content.

Give "example_folder" the following properties:
	realname="John Doe" (string)
	address="Example road 007\\12345 Foo town" (text)
	salutation="Mr Doe" (string)
	amount=42.0 (float)
	duration=7 (int)

Create a new File object in the example_folder. Call it "coin" and
	upload the file coin.png to its content.

Give "coin" the property suffix=".png" (string).

View the example_file object.
