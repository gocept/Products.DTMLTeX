The DTMLTeX usage example implements a letter. In order to see it
working, do the following:

Create a new folder in your Zope instance. Call it "example_folder".

Create a new DTMLTeX object in it. Call it "example". Upload the file
example.dtml to its content.

Create another new DTMLTeX object in it. Call it
"example_content". Upload the file example_content.dtml to its content.

Give "example_folder" the following properties:
	realname="John Doe" (ustring)
	address="Example road 007<newline>12345 Foo town" (utext)
	salutation="Mr Doe" (ustring)
	amount=42.0 (float)
	duration=7 (int)

Create a new File object in the example_folder. Call it "coin" and
upload the file coin.png to its content.

View the example object.
